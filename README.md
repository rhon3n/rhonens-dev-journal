# My Dev Journey
---- 

**The purpose for my journey as a developer is to creatively collaborate to solve problems in a human-centric way. A good test to see if that is being achieved is whether or not people are smiling while they use anything I work on or while collaborating on code I've written. Let's make the world a better place!**

Today, a friend that works for Nike let me know of a Software Engineer position that I think would be a perfect fit. It is a Front-end focused position with emphasis on resposive design and maintenance of stylesheets. I think it would be just the right amount of challenge for me and a great growth opportunity for my journey as a developer. I am excited at the prospect of applying for it!

For tonight, I will be focusing on learning React. I plan to build my trickster.coffee app with React for the front end. My goal for launching it is the end of April. Wish me luck!

I've just completed the codecademy intro to JS course and feel confident in my understanding of vanilla JS basics. After talking with a mentor, I've decided to start diving into React and Redux so that I can build a solid React portfolio project.

The course I've decided to begin with is the freecodecamp.org courses on React and Redux. From there I plan to create a simple web app to deploy to trickster.coffee. 

Oh yesâ€”my mentor said that he'd be bringing me "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin for me to begin reading. I'm very excited to dig into it!
