# My Dev Journey
---- 

**The purpose for my journey as a developer is to creatively collaborate to solve problems in a human-centric way. A good test to see if that is being achieved is whether or not people are smiling while they use anything I work on or while collaborating on code I've written.**

I've just completed the codecademy intro to JS course and feel confident in my understanding of vanilla JS basics. After talking with a mentor, I've decided to start diving into React and Redux so that I can build a solid React portfolio project.

The course I've decided to begin with is the freecodecamp.org courses on React and Redux. From there I plan to create a simple web app to deploy to trickster.coffee. 

Oh yes—my mentor said that he'd be bringing me "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin for me to begin reading. I'm very excited to dig into it!


### Thank you for taking a peep! 👀
