I've just completed the codecademy intro to JS course and feel confident in my understanding of vanilla JS basics. After talking with my mentor, I've decided to start diving into React and Redux so that I can build a solid portfolio website.

The course I've decided to begin with is the freecodecamp.org courses on React and Redux. From there I plan to create a simple web app to deploy to trickster.coffee.
